I am a Ph.D. student at the [College of Biomedical Engineering and Instrument Science](http://www.cbeis.zju.edu.cn/), [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/), under the supervision of [Prof. Fan Zhou](https://person.zju.edu.cn/fanzhou) and [Prof. Yaowu Chen](https://person.zju.edu.cn/0088219) from 2020 to present.
I used to serve as a research intern at _Apsara Lab, Alibaba Cloud_ from May, 2022 to Sept, 2024.
Now, I am visiting [NExT++ research center](https://www.nextcenter.org/team) at [National University of Singapore](https://nus.edu.sg/) as a joint Ph.D. student (supported by the [CSC](https://www.csc.edu.cn/) program), under the supervision of [Prof. Tat-Seng Chua](https://www.chuatatseng.com/) and [Dr. Hao Fei](https://haofei.vip/).

My research interests lie in uncertainty estimation, open-world learning, middle-level image analysis (recognition, detection, tracking, _etc._), vision-language applications, and large language models.
