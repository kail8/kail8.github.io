I am a Ph.D. student at the [College of Biomedical Engineering and Instrument Science](http://www.cbeis.zju.edu.cn/), [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/), during the supervision from [Prof. Fan Zhou](https://person.zju.edu.cn/fanzhou) and [Prof. Yaowu Chen](https://person.zju.edu.cn/0088219) from 2020 to present.
I am currently a reserch intern at City Brain Lab, [Alibaba DAMO Academy](https://damo.alibaba.com/).

My research interests lie in uncertainty estimation, middle-level image analysis (recognition, detection, tracking, _etc._), vision-language models, and large language models.
I'm always looking for related colaboration. If you are interested to chat with me, feel free to drop me an [email](kail@zju.edu.cn). Here is my [CV](/cv/).

Listed below are the accepted papers in top conferences and journals where I worked as the first author.
Here are the full lists of [publications](/publications/) and [projects](/projects/) that I participated in, and the corresponding source codes can be found in my [repositories](/repositories/).
I look forward to continuing to make valuable contributions to computer vision as well as natural language processing.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too.
